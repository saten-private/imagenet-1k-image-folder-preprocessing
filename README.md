```git clone https://github.com/saten-private/imagenet-1k-image-folder-preprocessing.git```

# Procedure
## train
1. Create a ```train``` folder under the repository.
2. Download ```train_images_X.tar.gz``` from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ILSVRC/imagenet-1k/tree/main/data).
3. Extract the images from ```train_images_X.tar.gz``` into the ```train``` folder.
4. Run ```python train_preprocessing.py```

## val
1.  Create a ```val``` folder under the repository.
2. Download ```val_images.tar.gz``` from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ILSVRC/imagenet-1k/tree/main/data).
3. Extract the images from ```val_images.tar.gz``` into the ```val``` folder.
4. Run ```python val_preprocessing.py```
